Disclaimer
----------
This doesn't have anything to do with actual law. There's no secret loophole that allows me to steal your children here, so if you're looking for that see [the license](LICENSE). On to what I was going to say. I know that this is a bad interpreter. I know that it is probably full of bugs. I know that it will probably never work quite right. I don't care. This is a presonal project. Feel free to [report such bugs as issues](https://github.com/FracturedRetina/BFshell/issues/new). If, however, by some quirk, it does work perfectly, that's awesome. Feel free to use it.

And here's a little extra warning for the UNIX people: I haven't tried compiling the UNIX version yet.
